# DataCellar Project

Welcome to the DataCellar project! This repository is organized into three main sub-folders, each dedicated to a specific aspect of the project. Below is an overview of each sub-folder and its purpose:

## 1. BackendAPIs

The `backendapis` folder contains the backend part of the DataCellar project. Here, you'll find all the necessary code and resources related to the server-side logic, data processing, and API endpoints. If you are a developer working on the backend aspects of the project, please refer to the [BackendAPIs README](backendapis/README.md) for detailed information on setting up the backend environment, API documentation, and other relevant details.

## 2. Marketplace

The `marketplace` folder encapsulates the frontend of the DataCellar project. This is where the user interface, client-side logic, and all frontend-related components reside. If you are working on the user interface or frontend functionalities, please check out the [Marketplace README](marketplace/README.md) for guidance on setting up the frontend environment, UI design principles, and any other pertinent information.

## 3. SmartContracts

The `smartcontracts` folder is dedicated to the blockchain part of the DataCellar project. Here, you will find the smart contracts and related resources for integrating blockchain functionality. If you are involved in blockchain development or smart contract deployment, refer to the [SmartContracts README](smartcontracts/README.md) for comprehensive information on setting up the blockchain environment, deploying smart contracts, and other blockchain-specific details.

Feel free to explore each sub-folder according to your role or area of interest in the project. If you have any questions or need additional assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to the project team.
